 (“MICHIGAN”).

BACKGROUND

1.   Faculty at the University of Michigan’s Department of Biophysics
have developed a proprietary software application and related
documentation, referred to as “RNAPosers”, for use by trained individuals
in Computational Biophysics and related analysis (hereinafter referred to as
"PROGRAM"); and

 2.   LICENSEE desires to obtain, and MICHIGAN, consistent with its
 mission of education and research, desires to grant, a license to use
 the PROGRAM subject to the terms and conditions set forth below; and

The parties therefore agree as follows:

I.    LICENSE

decompile, disassemble, modify, create derivative works of or publicly
display the PROGRAM, in whole or in part, unless expressly authorized by
this Agreement.

B.  LICENSEE agrees that it shall use the PROGRAM only for LICENSEE'S
sole and exclusive use, and shall not disclose, sell, license, or
otherwise distribute the PROGRAM to any third party without the prior
written consent of MICHIGAN. LICENSEE shall not assign this Agreement,
and any attempt by LICENSEE to assign it shall be void from the
beginning. LICENSEE agrees to secure and protect the PROGRAM and any
copies in a manner consistent with the maintenance of MICHIGAN'S rights
in the PROGRAM and to take appropriate action by instruction or
agreement with its employees who are permitted access to the PROGRAM in
order to satisfy LICENSEE'S obligations under this Agreement.

shall pay an Annual Fee of $2,500 for each additional year LICENSEE
wishes to use the PROGRAM; such Annual Fee shall be due and payable July

V.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

A.  THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. MICHIGAN DOES
NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE PROGRAM WILL MEET
LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR
FREE. MICHIGAN shall not be liable for special, indirect, incidental, or
consequential damages with respect to any claim on account of or arising
from this Agreement or use of the PROGRAM, even if MICHIGAN has been or
is hereafter advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some
states do not allow certain exclusions or limitations on implied
warranties or of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the
above exclusions may not apply to LICENSEE. In no event, however, will
MICHIGAN be liable to LICENSEE, under any theory of recovery, in an
amount in excess of the license fee  paid by LICENSEE under this
Agreement.

B.  LICENSEE agrees that MICHIGAN has no obligation to provide to
LICENSEE any maintenance, support, or update services. Should MICHIGAN
provide any revised versions of the PROGRAM to LICENSEE, LICENSEE agrees
that this license agreement shall apply to such revised versions.

LICENSEE warrants and represents that it will carefully review any
documentation or instructional material provided by MICHIGAN.

      shall have the right to immediately terminate the license granted
      herein, require the return or destruction of all copies of the
      PROGRAM from LICENSEE and certification in writing as to such
      return or destruction, and pursue any other legal or equitable
      remedies available.
